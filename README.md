# haskell.cafe

### What’s haskell.cafe

It’s my personal blog, sharing some my ideas and learning notes. But you can use it freely.

### Install

You should prepare `stack` first.

```
git clone https://github.com/jimmyhuco/haskell.cafe.git
cd haskell.cafe
stack setup
stack build
stack exec site watch
```

You can also read the article "[When I first meet the Hakyll](http://haskell.cafe/posts/2017-07-05-first-meet-hakyll.html)" that I wrote for it.

### TODO

As you may see, it's just work, not perfect. So I will refactor code in the
future. (My car-mad boy made me a busy father.)
