I'm a thoughtful man, have enough ideas to share and be recorded. So, it's time to
start a new blog.

In fact, I have not written any blog for a long time. I just remembered I put my
last blog down since I become a full-time leader. Every day is so busy that I
don't have enough time to enjoy myself. I spent more time to take care my team
and my product and my business.

About a year ago, I brought all those things to put down. I started to learn
Haskell that gives me the inspiration. I want to build something cool with tech
I like. At the same time, I had more time with my family. I enjoy myself now,
spend more time to play with my son. That's very important!

OK, let's go!
